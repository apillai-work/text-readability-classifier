    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create a text readability classifier (inspired by the flesch kincaid readability tests) that determines whether a piece of text is easy or hard to read. I shall be making use of english textbooks from South-East Asian / Middle Eastern areas as datasets. Since most readability classifiers use data from the United Kingdom / United States in their model, I thought it would be interesting to approach this problem using data from non-western regions to see if they could predict readability scores accurately for english phrases across the world. After building the classifier, I shall test it on speech / interview transcripts of various politicians as a use case to get a bit more insight into their speaking styles."

    "For this project, I'm using English textbooks of varying grades from different countries. I found all of them on [Library Genesis](https://www.libgen.is/) and since they were PDF files, I then converted them to text files using [Zamzar File Converter](https://www.zamzar.com/). I initially tried using python modules for this task like PDF Miner and PyPDF, but kept running into errors as most of the code I found on StackOverflow was not suitable with the latest version of Python. \n",

    "For this notebook, I have used a **first grade textbook from India from the NCERT Publication**, which can be found [here](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=ncert+english&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def), and a **twelth grade textbook from Afghanistan by the country's Ministry of Education (2011 Edition)**, which can be found [here](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=afghanistan+english&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def). The reason for doing so is to verify if the CNN classifier is performing better when given textbooks from two different regions (which turns out to be true in this case). "

    "I've used Regex and the Clean-Text Library to prepare the data before the classification task. I defined a 'read_and_clean' function to read any given text file and clean the data in it, whilst replacing the line-breaks according to every condition (as described in the comments) as the text files for this task aren't following a particular pattern with grammar since it was converted from an image-heavy PDF. After that, I'm splitting the sentence after every full stop ('.') and avoiding any sentences with less than two words as it won't be of much use.  "
