    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create a text readability classifier (inspired by the flesch kincaid readability tests) that determines whether a piece of text is easy or hard to read. I shall be making use of english textbooks from South-East Asian / Middle Eastern areas as datasets. Since most readability classifiers use data from the United Kingdom / United States in their model, I thought it would be interesting to approach this problem using data from non-western regions to see if they could predict readability scores accurately for english phrases across the world. After building the classifier, I shall test it on speech / interview transcripts of various politicians as a use case to get a bit more insight into their speaking styles."

After that, I'm splitting the sentence after every full stop ('.') and avoiding any sentences with less than two words as it won't be of much use.  "
