The Open University
1- Before you start.
Is it possible to get Islamic Khlafa again?
How do Muslims feel towards Khilāfah?

2- Read the text carefully and check your answers in 1.
he revival of Khilāfahh, which was announced by the spokesman
for Islamic State, Sheikh Abu Mohammed Al-Adnani on the first of
Ramadan 1435 H, surprised the true Muslims and shocked the nonMuslims all over the world.
eal announcement of Khilāfah surprised the true Muslims
positively and made the people inside the Waliyats of Islamic State
feel pleased and proud whereas the Muslims outside the Islamic
State have become eager to immigrate to it. Because they have been
under the rule of tawaghits since the collapse of Othmani Khilāfah in
1924. Now it is time for Real Islam, Sharia and Sunni, to take the ruling of
Islamic State over. The revival of Khilāfah means we are walking towards
the right path of satisfying Allah who orders us to leave all sorts of
governing people except applying Sharia and Sunni. That is the true way
to get happiness in both lives; here in the world and in the Day of
Judgment.
n the other side, the announcement of Khilāfah shocked the nonMuslims, such as jews, Christians, rafiddah, other sorts of kufar
and tawaghits negatively. All together announced their coalition
publicly to fight the Islamic State. The big question is "WHY?". Because
all of them deeply know that the path of applying Khilāfah means the end
of them altogether sooner or later.
inally, it can be said that the revival of Khilāfah amazed true
Muslims who were inside or outside the Islamic State whereas it
upset and troubled the non-Muslims all over the world.

Every Muslim is interested in reciting the Quran. However, it is
frustrating to find some people who are still away from reciting the
Quran. Therefore, we advise such people not to be frustrated because if
they start reciting it, they'll find it very interesting. They'll never get bored
with it. The best way of not being bored is to deeply recite the Quran now
and then, because it makes you feel satisfied, convinced and relaxed.

Importance of Second / Foreign Language
1- Before you start.
 How many languages do you know?
 What is the mental benefit of learning a foreign language?

2- Read the article and answer the questions on the next page.
A recent study says that speaking two languages can help old
people to keep mentally active. Young people learning a second or a
foreign language can keep them mentally active when they get older. A
group of researchers at one university carried out some experiments.
Then they asked 104 people between the ages of 30 and 88 to do them.
From the tests, the researchers found out that people who can speak two
languages are good at thinking fast. The group carried out different
experiments and concluded that being bilingual can help old people to
think quickly.
The group thinks that speaking different languages is very good for
you and your brain. Half of the people who did the tests came from
Indonesia and only spoke their mother tongue. The other half came from
India and could speak English and a language called Tamil. The group
tested the two halves in vocabulary skills and mathematics ability. They
checked how fast the people did the activity. The ones who spoke two
languages did the exercises quickly and well. The people who spoke only
one language weren't as good.

Learning a second or foreign language when we are young can help
us when we are old. Leaning in general can certainly help the brain to
stay active.

He said, ''I don't think so."
He said (that) He didn't think so.
 Look at the sentences numbered below in the interview. What do we
call each one?
Interviewer: Dr. Abdullah (1) "Do you think sleep is a waste of time
for teenagers? Dr. Abdullah said, (2) "I don't think so." "Teenagers should
take enough sleep to grow healthy and stay strong.
Interviewer: "What do you advise the teenagers who stay up late?"
Dr. Abdullah said (3) "Go to bed at the same time every night." "Don't do
anything exciting before bed; instead recite some verses from the
Quran." Now you know what to do before sleeping, you will feel much
better in the morning. Finally, we can say that sleep is not a waste of time.
Note: "I don't think so." Is called direct speech. When we often tell people
what other people have said, it is called reported or indirect speech, e.g.

Dr. Abdullah said that he didn't think so.
Sentence No. (1) in the interview above is called "Question", No.(2) is
"Statement" and No. (3) is called "Request

How can you remember?
1- Before you start.
- Is it important to revise the information you learn from time to time?
- How long does it take to forget the information we learn?

2- Look at the first graph which shows the percentage of
learning remembered, (vertical) and the time since initial
learning (horizontal). Three colours are used, green one
which shows regular review, blue one review after ten
minutes and the brown one which shows no review.

Now read and check your answers in 1.
Within 24 hours of learning, we almost forget 80% of the new
information and after a month only about 10% remains. The big question
is how we can stop or reduce the loss of information. Simply, the answer
11

is reviewing regularly. Does it need to revise every day? Not necessarily,
but the first revision is very important which must be after 10 minutes. If
you look at the blue line how it raises memory to 100%, but if we do not
look at the information again, we will forget nearly everything over time.
Thus, it is very important to revise regularly. If we revise after one day as
shown in the graph, one month and then six months as shown in the
green line, we will remember the information for ever, because the
information will be now in long-term memory.
What happens while revising? Which revising hour is the best for
us, first, second etc.? Which information can we remember better, the
first one or the last one? When we revise for a test, for example we need
nearly 4 hours, the information in the first and second hours will probably
be remembered better than the things you revise in the last two hours.
The reason is that we revise the information without taking break after
each hour. We should take at least 10 minutes break after an hour of
revising. Look at the second graph and check how much information you
can remember.

3- Answer the questions below.
- How long does it take to retain 10 % of the new information?
- What is the best way to keep the information?
- Which information will be the best in a test, first hour of revising or the
last hour?

11

- What do advise students while revising for long hours?
Do you agree with these ideas in this topic? Why? Why not?

4- Write T if the statement is true, and F if it is false.
a. We nearly forget 80 % of the new information and after two weeks only
about 10 % remains. (
)
b. The second revision is very important which must be after 10 minutes.
(
)
c. It is important to revise regularly. (
)
d. The best revising hour is the last one. (

e. We forget the information while revising because we do not take break.

yourself nor others". Moreover, those warnings tell us that smoking
is very dangerous. It damages your health. Warning statements are
everywhere you find it on cigarette packets, it says, "Leave smoking

11

forever. It is one of the main reasons for cancer." Such phrases are
not written on food, or drink packets, yet a number of people still
smoke.

3- Look at the examples below and do as required.
a. He ordered us, "Stop smoking". (Direct speech)
 He ordered us to stop smoking. (Reported speech)
b. They asked me, "Would you carry these bags for me, please?"
(Direct Speech)
 They asked me to carry those bags for him. (Reported speech)
- Look at the examples "a" and "b" abovex and guess which one is
formal and which one is informal.
Rule
We use the infinitive (to do / to stay / to take etc.) in reported
speech, especially with tell and ask (for orders and requests).
There are two methods of expressing requests: informal and
formal.
Example for informal:
"Stay in bed for a few days." The doctor said to me.
The doctor told me to stay in bed for a few days.
"Don't speed up" I asked the taxi driver.
I asked the taxi driver not to speed up.
Example for formal:
"Would you mind opening that door, please?" a stranger asked
me.
A stranger asked me to open the door.
-Check your answer in 3.
Now do the following.
a. "Could you open the door, please?" a stranger asked me.
b. The man asked me "Don't park your car here."
c. "Stop here "a man warned me".
d. "Turn the TV off" my father asked me.

Once you decide
1- Before you start.
 How do you make a decision?
 Have you ever regretted a decision?

2- Read the text.
You may need to take a decision every day, every week, every
month etc. But is your decision good or not? What are the steps of good
decision-making? A lot of people make decisions without really thinking
about them. They probably use their instinct and they believe that they
just hope they have done the right thing. However, such a decision
making is no good in business, or in big things in every day's life.
Making decisions is not a moment in time, but it is process. It can
be said that making decision is embodied in six process steps:
1. Define the problem.
2. Imagine a successful solution.
3. Generate alternative possibilities.
4. Evaluate the possibilities.
5. Select the best possibility.
6. Tell people your decision.
Let's have a look at the example of the process of action. Let's
define the problem first. You may come late to school. Secondly, let's
imagine that the successful solution for this problem is to arrive 5
minutes before the first lesson. Now you need to generate a list of
alternative possibilities, for example, take a taxi, go with your father's car,
take the bus, ride your bike etc. You can go through those alternatives
with your father or even with your friend and think of the difficulties of
each alternative. Then it is time to select the best possibility. Finally, tell
19

people around you your final decision, but remember not all your
decisions are perfect even if you follow the process of taking good
decisions because you forget one important thing. It is to follow the
advice of our prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) before taking
decision, you should pray to Allah to choose for you the best alternative
to take the final decision. Thus, the good decision should be taken after
istikhara (decisions) prayer, even if you discover later on it was not a
good decision, but indeed it is good for you because no one knows which
one is good or bad, but Almighty Allah.

3- Check your answers in 1.
4- Answer the questions below.
a. Is it good to use instinct to take a business decision?
b. What is making decision?
c. How many steps one should follow before telling people his or her
decision?
d. Do you think that the six process steps are active in a decision?
Why? Why not?

5- Write T if the statement is true and F if it is not.
a. Very few people make decisions without really thinking about
them. (
)
b. It is very good to use our instinct to take a decision in big things
in every day's life. (
)
c. There is no need to define the problem in taking decisions.
(
)
d. After studying the possibilities, one should select one of them.

anything. I went on working until I heard another noise. It seemed to be
coming from my sister's room, so I thought I'd better look into it so I
opened the door and saw that she had two of my big books in front of
her. "What are you looking up?" I said in surprise, because she is only
just learned to read. "Oh! I'm not looking anything up," She replied. "I

Grammar Summary
Deduction
Form: modals + have + past participle
Example:
 You must left your money at home. (deduction: I'm sure you did)
 She can't have written that book. (deduction: I'm sure she didn't)
 He might / may / could have taken a taxi. (deduction: perhaps he did)
Adjectives
Adjectives describe a noun and are used in front of nouns. They have the
same form of singular and plural. They do not change for male and
female, e.g.
This beach is fantastic.

That train is fast.

Note
- When we have more than one adjective, we use this order:
Opinion (lovely, easy), size (large, long), age (old, young), shape (round,
square), colour (green, blue), origin (Japanese, Sudanese), material
(plastic, wooden), e.g. an old Pakistani leather ball (age, origin, material)
a lovely small green and black dress (opinion, size, colour).
 Adjectives can be made stronger or weaker with the use of
intensifier; very, a bit, extremely, e.g.
This is very dangerous.
 Adjectives with verb to be, become, feel, look need no nouns, e.g.
He became strong and happy.
 We can use one instead of repeating a noun, e.g. I admire your idea.
It's really smart one.

88

Adjectives ending -ing and -ed
Adjectives with -ing endings:
These adjectives describe something as a book, a person etc. e.g.
 He thinks computers game are boring.
 The last IS DVDs were really exciting.
Adjectives ending with -ed:
These adjective describe your feelings about something as a book, a
person etc. e.g.
 He gets bored when her brother players computer games.
 I was really excited when I saw the IS DVDs.
Futures forms
 Will
Form: The will future is formed with the infinitive without to. The negative
form of will is will not, the contraction form is won't. Will is usually
shortened in speech and informal writing to 'll.
Some speaker use shall to refer to future in formal situations with I and
we. However, this use is becoming very rare. In modern English shall is
used for suggestions only:
Shall I close the window?
Future use
We use will to talk about future beliefs, opinions, hopes and predictions.
There is usually a time expression. We can add perhaps, probably, or
definitely to show how certain or uncertain we are about our predictions.
 In the next century, most people will probably live in big cities.
 Perhaps it'll rain tomorrow.

Notice that probably comes after will but will before won't.
89

 They'll probably go with us tonight.
 They probably won't go with us tonight.
Other uses of will
We use will to express spontaneous decisions that come into our head
at the moment of speaking, promises etc.
 The phone is ringing. I'll answer it. (spontaneous decision)
 I'll do my best to help you. (promise)
 Going to
Form of going to:
The be (am /is / are) going to is formed with the verb be + going to + the
infinitive.
 He is going to learn to drive.
 They are going to travel Madienah next year.
Use of going to:
We use be + going to + the infinitive for plans and intentions. The plan
may be in the near future or more distant.
 I'm going to do a lot of things this evening.
 I 'm going to join the Islamic Army after finishing my sharia study.
We also use be + going to + the infinitive for predictions, but when there
is an evidence in the present situation. For example: There are two young
drivers driving their cars in a very narrow road. They are going to make
an accident.
Note:
Will and going to are both used for predictions, and most occasions
either possible, but if there is strong evidence in the present situation,
then going to is usually used.
Look at the heavy clouds in the sky. I think it is going to rain very soon.

91

Present continuous for future
Form of present continuous:
The present continuous is formed with the auxiliary verb to be and the ing form of the main verb.
I am + v +-ing…

He is + v +-ing…

She is + v +-ing…

It is + v +-ing…

You are + v +-ing…

We are + v +-ing…

They are + v +-ing…
e.g. I am watching … He is watching …

You are watching …

Use of present continuous
We use present continuous to talk about things we have arranged to do,
in particular social arrangement and appointments. There is nearly
always a time expression.
A: What are you doing tomorrow?
B: Not really. Why?
A: I' visiting some wounded mujahedeen in hospital. Would you like to
come?
B: Oh! I'd love to.
Note:
Going to or present continuous?
Both forms, going to and present continuous, are used for plans and
arrangements, and in most occasions either is possible, e.g.
 I'm having feat next week.
 I'm going to have feat next week.
However, going to can suggest that the details are not yet finalized. It's
still just a plan. Whereas the present continuous can suggest that the
arrangement is more fixed with a time and a place.
90

 He is going to have another lesson in shooting. (a plan with no
specific time)
 He is having another shooting lesson tonight. (it's fixed in his diary)
Phrasal verbs
The tem phrasal verbs means a normal verb like get, take, look followed
by one or two prepositions or adverb like back, off, up. Look at these
examples:
 Please take this note to my teacher. (take here means to move
something from one place to another)
 Take off your shoes before you come in masjid. (take here means
to remove something)
 We took off in the middle of the storm. (took, past form of take, here
means when a plane goes up into the air)
When the preposition is added the meaning of the original verb changes.
Sometimes there is a relationship and you can guess the meaning as in
2 above. Sometimes there is a new meaning that is completely different
as in 3 above.
Note
 Phrasal verbs are in different types depending on whether there is
one preposition or two and whether the verb and the preposition
can be separated.
 Phrasal verbs are common in informal writing and speech.
 Phrasal verbs are in three types: 1- with object 2- without object 3within object.
Examples:
 Could you deal with this customer's problem, please? (with object)
 When he started his speech, everyone joined in. (without object)
I looked this word up in a dictionary. (within object = object occurs
between the main verb and the preposition)
Note
Phrasal verbs can be in three parts, e.g.
91

 I'm looking forward to seeing you very soon.
 You can rest now and catch up with us later.
Reported speech
There are three types of reported speech; statement, question and
request.
Statements
We often tell people what other people have said. This is called reported
or indirect speech. We rarely report the exact words, usually we just give
a general summary, e.g.
 Salman said to Omar, "I'll call you later tonight." (direct speech)
 Salman said to Omar (that) he would call him later that night.
(reported)
We usually join the first part "Salman said to Omar" with the statement
between the quotation marks "…" with that, but you can drop it out. Then,
the verb is usually changed will into would. Accordingly, pronouns are
also changed; I into he, you into him. Finally, some words or expressions
are changed from direct speech into reported, today into that day.

Note: The (that) between brackets means you can use or drop it.
Study the table below.
Tenses
Examples

messages to him.
"They are going to go faster."
He said (that) they were going to go
faster.
"I will be home tomorrow."
He said (that) he would be home
the next day.

Note
We often need to change pronouns when we report what someone said:
I
he or she
You
them or us
my
his or her
we
they
our

Example:
 "I can't go out with you because my father kept my money."

his money.

Words about time and place also change:

e.g.

 He said (that) he often bought bread there in that shop.
Questions
There are two kinds of questions; Wh-questions and Yes/No, questions,
e.g.
 How is your arm?
 He asked me how his arm was. (not how was his arm?)
We sometimes use different verbs instead of "asked", e.g. I wanted to
know or I wondered if
Note: tenses also changed in questions as in the statements.
Requests
When we ask politely for information we use the same word order as in
reported questions:
 Can you tell me when the job starts? (not can you tell me when does
the job start?)
We don't change the tense
There is no change for might, could, should, would, but must has two
forms.
 "I must leave all sins"
 He said (that) he must leave all sins.
But we can say
 He said (that) he had to leave all sins.

91

Questions
We can report questions with verbs like ask, wonder and want to know.
Tenses change rules as in the statements. There are two types of
questions; Wh-question and Yes / No question, e.g.





Notes
The word order in a reported question is like a normal statement, with the
subject before the verb.
When we report Yes /No question, we use if or whether.
Do, does, or did is omitted, other auxiliary verbs are not e.g. "Are you an
engineer?" he asked. He asked if I was an engineer.
Requests are reported with ask and the infinitive, e.g.
 "Please, wait." He asked me.
 He asked me to wait
