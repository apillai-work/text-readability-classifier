give Spot milk. Spot does not like rice, so I give him cat
food. Spot is an active animal. He likes to run around
the house. He likes to chase everyone in my house.
When he feels tired or sleepy, Spot usually sleeps on
the sofa in the living room or sometimes under the

Cockatoos

Cockatoos are
extremely affectionate,
their feathers are very soft.
They are real intelligent
and very inquisitive birds!
Cockatoos love to show
off and make comical
displays with outspread
wings, head bobbing,
dancing and loud calls.
They are very active
and curious about their
environment.
The term “cockatoo”
is a Malaysian word
thought to have possibly
two meanings, “pincher”
or “old father”.

There is an eagle nesting
on the tree top near my grandparent’s house in Pangandaran.
It was a sea eagle.
The color of its feathers
is light brown. It has a strong
and sharp yellowish beak.
Its claws are very sharp. It
hunts for Àsh in the sea but
sometimes it hunts chickens
Source: CD Image
and small birds.
Eagles have many sizes, shapes, and colors, but
the sea eagle is easy to recognise because it has a
strong a streamlined, sharp beak and a stream-line
body.
Its forelimbs (or arms) serve as wings. This means
that they are of little use for anything except Áying.
It walks on two legs and has a very Áexible neck and
strong beak to handle foods, to care for its feathers,
and for many other jobs that non-Áying animals do
with paws, claws, or hands on their forelimbs.

Note
Characteristics of Descriptive Text
• A descriptive text is a text that describes the features
of someone, something, or a certain place.
• Introduction is the part of the paragraph that
introduces the character.
Example : Paragraph 1 in Sea Eagle text.
• Description is the part of the paragraph that
describes the character.
Example : The color of its feathers is light brown. It has
a strong and sharp yellowish beak.

Study the following text carefully.
Nusa Tenggara
Nusa Tenggara is the name for the chain of islands
which lies to the east of Bali. Including the islands of
Komodo, Lombok, Flores and Timor, Nusa Tenggara
spans a variety of landscapes, from tropical forests,
high volcanic lakes and dry savannahs. The largest
islands are Lombok and Sumbawa, with hundreds
of smaller islands between. East Nusa Tenggara has
566 islands. The long northern arch of the island
chain is the result of volcanic activity, whilst the
southern islands are formed from coral deposits.
Most of the eastern islands are arid, due to hot winds
blowing from the continent of Australia and sparsely
vegetated. The Western half of Nusa Tenggara is
moister and has denser vegetation. The Northern part
of the chain is known for deep lakes contained in the
craters of extinct volcanoes, the most famous of which
are the coloured mineral lakes on Gunung Keli Mutu
in Flores

Horizon

Adolescence is a
transitional stage of
human development
that occurs between
childhood and adulthood.
Adolescent humans
go through puberty,
the process of sexual
maturation. Teenagers
(ages 13-19) are usually
adolescent, though in
some individuals, puberty
may extend a few gears
beyond the teenage years,
and in some individuals,
puberty begins in the preteen years.

Last night, I read an article about adolescence in a
magazine. I learned that it was a time of change between
childhood and adulthood.
After I finished reading the article from the
magazine, I remembered my own adolescence. I
was fourteen at that time. I felt very emotional about
everything. But I tried to learn more about myself.
I tried to discover what I wanted to do, and what kind
of people I wanted to be.
To divert my emotions, I took many extra

Last Saturday I woke up early, but I didn’t get up
because there was no school. Suddenly, my telephone
was rung. It was my friend Fanny, she asked me to go
out at 10.00 o clock. She wanted to buy something in
traditional market.
Finally, we were out. In the street, I saw a piece of
pink coupon. Interested with its colour, I took it, then
Fanny and I read this out. We were fully shocked, it
was a receipt of a four nights tour to Lombok !! The
expired date was that day. To our surprised, the name
was Fanny Fenita and the birth date was exactly the
same like Fanny my friend, and it was also valid for
two persons. My God!! We were thinking that maybe
the coupon just fell from the sky and it was there for
us.
We were in hurried to the address of the tour
agency that issued the coupon. The tour agency took
care of everything. We went home and still could not
believe what was going on. Two days later we were on
the Senggigi Beach, lied in the warmth sun. Moreover,
we had long public holiday, so we could enjoy the
“gift” happily. We also bought some presents for our
family and friends.

Bandung, May 3, 2008
Dear Diary,
I had a bad experience this morning. I had just celebrated my 15th birthday
yesterday. The party was very good. When I woke up this morning, I felt very
happy about the party.
I got on with my usual morning activities and went to school. When I arrived
at school and entered my classroom, everybody was looking at me. I wondered,
“why are they looking at me?”
I didn’t think about it much, so I sat in my usual chair. Suddenly, all of my
friends were laughing. They were pointing at my face. I felt very embarrassed so I
ran to the rest room. There was a mirror there. I looked to the mirror to ﬁnd out
why. I was surprised to see a big red pimple on my forehead. My classmates were
laughing at me because I looked like an Indian actress. I had never had pimple
before, so the whole day I had to cover my forehead with a head band.
This is a diary in the form of recount. It is almost similar to a narrative
text. But recount is usually shorter. Now write your own diary excerpt
about an event that you never forget. It could be a sad story, funny
story, or an amazing experience. Use these following questions to

Octopus

The Octopus is a sea animal with
eight powerful feet which it uses as
hands. These are called tentacles. The
word “Octopus” comes from two greet
words that mean “eight feet”.
The octopus, the squid and the
cuttleÀsh belong to the same family that
has no outside shells. Their bodies are
covered entirely with skin. Therefore the
body of an octopus is soft. It looks like
a big balloon. A fully-grown octopus can
be as large as 8,5 metres from the tip of
one tentacles to the tip of another. It can
weigh as much as 45 kilograms.
Besides using its tentacles to catch
small Àsh, sea plants, crab and lobsters,
the octopus also uses them against its
enemies. The octopus wraps its tentacles
around the victim and squeezes it before
eating it.
The octopus escapes from its enemies
by giving out a thick dark Áuid to darken
the water. It can also change the colour
of its body to match its surroundings. It
hides from its enemies by doing this.

Once upon a time there lived two best friends, the

One day, the hare asked the tortoise to race down
to the beach. The tortoise refused, he said that he will
loose anyway. The hare replied in a kind voice that he
felt sorry about it.
But the next day, the hare found a way to race the
tortoise that would be fair and lots of fun too. He asked
the tortoise to come with him. The tortoise was slowly
plodding over the sandhill towards the beach. Now
the two friends can race against each other all day and
something tells me that the tortoise might win this time.

Once upon a time, there lived a kind young prince
named Jonathan. He was loved, and adored by his people.
His two close friends were Peter Piper, the servant of the
palace and Franklin Greedy, the son of an Aristocrat.
One day, The Prince, Peter Piper, and Franklin
Greedy were walking through the forest. Suddenly a
group of bandits attacked the three boys near an old
house. They entered the old house and blockaded the
gate and doors. The three boys were trapped inside
the house.

Franklin was very terriÀed and asked the Prince
to surrender immediately, but Peter was not afraid.
He urged and supported the Prince not to give up. The
Prince decided not to surrender because he realised
that he would become a hostage for the bandits to
ask for ransom to his father, but Franklin was scared
and wanted to make a deal, it made Peter suspicious
about Franklin’s behaviour. So he quietly made up a
plan for him and the Prince to escape.
Early at dawn, Franklin opened the front gate and
unlocked the doors. The bandits entered the house
in search of the Prince. When they came to the room
where the Prince was supposed to be sleeping, no
one was there. Suddenly they heard a horse running
outside the house and saw over the window that
Peter Piper and the Prince were riding away on one
of the bandit’s horses.
It turns out, Peter Piper sneaked out of the house
and waited in the yard, while the Prince was hiding
behind the house. The bandits were very angry at
Franklin and took him with them while the Prince
and Peter went safely going back to the Capital.

Little Mantu lived in a village deep in the jungle
where elephants helped the men with their work.
These elephants were so big and strong. They could
lift up the heaviest logs with their trunks and toss
them high in the air.
Now, Mantu had an elephant of his very own. His
name was Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved
him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that
someday he would become the biggest, strongest and
bravest elephant in the jungle. The other elephants
heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises
with their trunks. “We’re so big and tall, but you’re
so small. You’re nothing at all,” said one of the big
elephants.

Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a
mishievous glint in his eye. “You’re so tall and can
see far away. We can see what is happening down
here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the Àrst to see
any slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After
hearing the word snakes, the elephants screeched
and off they gwents thundering in fright.
“Did I say there were snakes?” giggled Mantu. “No,
I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon
his little friend’s back and went home to the village to tell
everyone about the foolish elephants.

a.

Arion did not put up a struggle; instead he asked only
that he be allowed to sing one last song. His wish was
granted and the sailors were so enchanted by his voice
that they were hardly aware of what happened next. At
the Àrst notes of his song, a dolphin swam alongside,
attracted by the beautiful music. Immediately Arion
jumped overboard onto the dolphin’s back and was
carried back across the sea.
b. In memory of this event, a statue, of a young man
on the back of a dolphin, was erected in the port of
Corinth. This statue is still there today.
c. Arion was one of the most famous singers in the
ancient world. On one occasion he won an important
festival in Sicily, and as his prize he received so many
jewels and golden cups that he was obliged to hire a
ship to carry them all home to Corinth.
d. When the ship Ànally reached port in Corinth, the
wicked sailors began to tell everyone that there
had been a storm, during which the famous singer
had been lost at sea. They were struck dumb with
amazement, however, when Arion arrived with a
company of soldiers to arrest them.
e. Unfortunately, this huge treasure made the sailors
very jealous, and in order to have it for themselves,
they attacked the singer and were about to throw
him overboard.

When I was in junior high school, I was not a very
diligent student. In fact, I was quite lazy. I hated all the
subjects that I took during school, especially science.
For me science was very difÀcult. It was hard for me to
remember the chemical processes, physics calculations,
and biological processes.

Personal Experience

115

Once, my teacher grounded me in the library
because I did not do my Biology homework. The teacher
asked me to read several books and make a summary
about them. When I was browsing the shelves, I found
a book entitled “The inventors of Medicine”. I thought
“OK, this is a start”. I took it out then began reading it.
I learned from the book about Edward Jenner. He
was an English doctor who found the cure for smallpox.
The next one was Louis Pasteur. His interest in bacteria
led him to discover the treatments for rabies and anthrax.
Just like Pasteur, Robert Koch’s experiments on bacteria
also proved that tuberculosis can be spread to others
by contact. Finally, there was Alexander Flemming, a
British bacteriologist who found the Àrst antibiotic and
penicillin.
After I read the book, I realised that science is useful
for human kind. By studying, we can discover things
that can help human kind. Therefore, since that moment,
I managed to change my behaviour and became a
doctor.

With Mr Sentana, our team won many tournament

Hello Paula, how are you? It’s been a month since I last heard from
you. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I was in a hospital last week.
According to the doctor; I was infected by dengue fever.
At ﬁrst, I felt my body became weak then I fainted when I was
studying in the classroom. Then, I was taken to the hospital because of
the high fever.
At the hospital, I was brought into the emergency unit. The doctor
immediately gave some treatment. Finally, I had to stay there for one
week. Everyday the doctor kept me on a drip.
At the seventh day, my condition was getting better. After the ﬁnal
check, the doctor gave me permission to go home. Now, I’m okay and
because of my illness, I am now more careful about keeping in my house
clean especially my room, I don’t want to get the same illness again.
OK, I think that’s all from me, write to me soon ok?
Regards
Nadira

There was once a nightingale in a cage by a window,
that was his habit to sing only at night. An owl was
puzzled by this and went to ask the nightingale what
the reason was. “When I was captured, “ explained
the nightingale, “it was day and I was singing. In this
way I learnt to be more carefully and to sing only at
night.”
“Are you afraid you might be captured a second
time?” asked the owl. “Oh, it would have been better
if you had been more careful the Àrst time when your
freedom was at risk. Now it doesn’t really matter any
more, right?”

The Caliph of Baghdad hired an intelligent and

amused by his clever, witty comments. The clown
was so well loved by his master that everyone at court
showed him great respect. And so the Caliph was
much surprised one day when he heard his beloved
clown crying out in distress from the throne room.
The Caliph hurried there and was astonished to Ànd
the guards beating the clown badly.
“Leave him alone at once!” he ordered. “Why are
you beating him?”
“We found him sitting on your throne, O majesty!”
the captain of the guards explained.
“out of my sight!” commanded the Caliph. “For
sure the jester did not do it with the intention of
offending me.”
The clown, however, continued to weep and wail
even after the guards had left.

“Certainly! If I get beaten so badly for having
been only a few minutes on the throne, how many
beatings must you have suffered in all the years that
you have been there?”

Telaga Warna
Long long ago there was a kingdom in West Java.
The kingdom was ruled by a king. People called their
king His Majesty Prabu. Prabu was a kind and wise
king. No wonder if that country was prosperous.
There’s no hunger in this kingdom.
It was a very happy condition. But it was a pity
that Prabu and his queen hadn’t got any children. It
made the royal couple very very sad. Some old men

140

English in Focus for Grade VIII

and women who was respected by Prabu suggested
the king to adopt a child. But Prabu and the queen
didn’t agree. “No, thank you. But for us, our own
daughter or son is better than adopted children.”
The queen was very sad. She often cried. That
was why Prabu decided to go. He went to the jungle.
There he prayed to God. Everyday he begged for a
child. His dream come true. A few months later, the
queen got fregnant. All people in the kingdom felt
happy. They sent many presents to the palace to
express their happiness.
Nine months later a princess was born. People
sent their presents again as a gift to a little princess.
This baby grew as a beautiful teenager then.
Prabu and Queen loved their daughter so much.
They gave what ever she wanted. It made Princess a
very spoiled girl. When her wish couldn’t be realized,
she became very angry. She even said bad things
often. A true princess wouldn’t do that. Eventhough
the princess behaved badly, her parents loved her, so
did the people in that kingdom.
Day by day, the princess grew more beautiful.
No girls couldn’t compare with her. In a few days,
Princess would be 17 years old. So, people of that
kingdom went to palace. They brought many presents
for her. Their presents gift were very beautiful.
Prabu collected the presents. There were really many
presents. Then Prabu stored them in a building. Some
times he could take them to give to his people.
Prabu only took some gold and jewels. Then
she brought them to the goldsmith. “Please make a
beautiful necklace for my daughter,” said Prabu. “My
pleasure, Your Majesty,” the goldsmith replied. The
goldsmith worked with all his heart and his ability.
He wanted to create the most beautiful necklace in
the world because he loved his princess.
The birthday came. People gathered in the palace
Àeld. When Prabu and queen appeared, people
welcomed them happily. Prabu and his wife waved
to their beloved people.

Cheers were louder and louder when the princess
appeared with her fabulous pretty face. Everybody
admired her beauty. Prabu got up from his chair.
A lady gave him a small and glamourous pillow.
A wonderful necklace was on it. Prabu took that
necklace. “My beloved daughter, today I give this
necklace to you. This necklace is a gift from people in
this country. They love you so much. They presented
it for you to express their happiness, because you have
growing to a woman. Please, wear this necklace,” said
Prabu.
Princess accepted the necklace. She looked at
the necklace in a glance. “I don’t want to accepted it!
It’s ugly!” shouted the princess. Then she threw the
necklace. The beautiful necklace was broken. The
gold and jewels were spread out on the Áoor
Everybody couldn’t say anything. They never
thought that their beloved princess would did that
cruel thing. Nobody spoke. In their silence people
heard the queen crying. Every woman felt sad and
began crying too. Then everybody was crying.
Then there was a miracle. Earth was crying.
Suddenly, from the under ground, a spring emerged.
It made a pool of water. The palce was getting full.
Soon the place became a big lake. The lake sank all of
the kingdom.
Nowadays the water on that lake is not as full as
before. There is only a small lake now. People called
the lake “Talaga Warna”. It is mean “Lake of Colour”.
It’s located in Puncak, West Java. On a bright day, the
lake is full of colour. So beautiful and amazing. These
colors come from shadows of forest, plants, Áowers,
and sky arround the lake. But some people said that
the colours are from the princess’s necklace, which
spreads at the bottom of the lake.

Young Giraffes
You and I learnt to walk when we
were a few months old, but baby giraffes
can walk after only twenty minutes. Baby
giraffes live in a dangerous world. Lions
and other animals like to eat them, so the
babies must learn quickly. They learn to
run fast and to stay on their feet almost
all of the time. Even at night, giraffes do
not lie down. They stand by a tree and
sleep. Big giraffes have long legs and
they can run at Àfty kilometres per hour.
The English word giraffe comes from the
Arabic word xirapha. The word means
'runs fast'.
Giraffe’s also have very long tongues.
A giraffes tongue can be Àfty centimetres
long! Giraffes use their tongues for
cleaning them selves! Their tongues are
important for other things too. A giraffe’s
favourite food is green leaves from acacia
trees. These trees have sharp thorns,
but the giraffe’s tongue can go between
the thorns. The giraffe’s long neck is
important because the best leaves are at
the tops of the trees. Giraffes love these
leaves, and they eat for about eighteen
hours every day.

Do You Know This Girl?
I was in the park with my older sister,

money in her hand. When she saw us, she

I said to my sister. “Did you have any

She said, “Yes, Anna, I did.”
I said, “Look in your jacket quickly.”
Cathy looked in her jacket, but her
money was not there.
“That girl stole it!” I said, and we all
ran after her. We caught her quickly.
My sister was very angry and she
said, ”Give me the money!” The girl gave
the money to Cathy and ran away. We all
ran after her, but we lost her.
Then we went home. But before we
could tell our parents, my mother said to
Cathy, “You left your money at home. It's
on the table in the sitting room. You must
be more careful with money.”
So the girl in the red T-shirt was not
a thief! She probably thought we were
thieves! We felt terrible.

not always dangerous, but this shark
could smell blood. When sharks smell
blood, they want to kill and eat. The
shark's teeth closed on the dead Àsh and
pulled the spear gun from Sam's hand.
Sam and Lizzie swam quickly to a
small island. The island was only a metre
wide and a few centimetres above the
water. Sam pushed Lizzie up into the
island and then he climbed up. He fell
and cut his leg.
Then they stood on the island and
watched the shark.
“We're OK,” Sam told his sister.
“Someone will see us.” But there was
a bigger island between them and the
beach. So nobody could see them.

“We have to swim to the bigger
island,” Sam said.
“People will see us there.”
“You can't swim,” Lizzie said. “The
sharks will smell the blood on your leg,
and ...”
The water washed over their little
island again. The water was higher then
before. They nearly fell in again.
“We can't stay here. We have to
swim,” Sam said.
“No,” Lizzie said. “I have to swim.”
“What do you mean?”
“You can't go, so I'll go. I'll get
help.”
“No! Lizzie!”
But she was already in the water. She
swam fast. All the time she thought, “Are
the sharks behind me?”
The sharks began to move towards
Lizzie. Sam watched. What could he do?
He put his legs in the water. He kicked
the water and shouted at the sharks. The
sharks heard the noise and they smelled
the blood from his leg. They turned. They
came towards him, but he kept his feet in
the water and kicked. Then Lizzie was at
the bigger island, and Sam jumped up.
Lizzie waved her arms at the people
on the beach and shouted “Help!”
A few minutes later, Sam and Lizzie
were safe in a boat.
“Are you OK, Sam?” Lizzie asked.

Sam said, “Lizzie, you're the best
and bravest sister in the world. You can
swim with me any time.”
“But no more spear Àshing?” she
said with a smile.
”Ok. No more spear Àshing.”

Little Brother, Little Sister
Maltreated by their stepmother, who
was a witch, a little brother and sister Áed
into the woods. After running for a while,
the brother said: 'I'm so thirsty. Let's Ànd
a spring and have a drink.'

However, as the young boy bent
down to drink, his sister heard a
voice which said: 'Who drinks from
me will turn into a fawn.' it was the
witch! Too late, the sister tried to
prevent her brother from drinking.
The young boy changed at once into
a fawn. In tears, the little girl made a
lead and collar out of her belt, and led
the fawn off into the woods. There
they found an abandoned cottage and
lived together, far from any danger.
One day, however, the king was
hunting in the woods, and he spied
the fawn, which could not resist
the urge to wander away from the
cottage. The king and his hunters
chased the fawn all the way back
home. There, the king followed it into
the cottage, where he found a young
girl stroking the frightened animal.
She was so beautiful and gentle that
the king fell in love with her at once.
He asked her to be his wife, and his
words caused the maiden to cry for
joy. When one of her tears fell on the
fawn, it changed back to her brother
once more. Their goodness and love
had overcome the witch's evil spell,
and they lived safely and happily
with the king for ever after.

The Àrst time I remember seeing
Josephine (54)
when I was working in
a store. She was taking her dog for a walk
and was doing her shopping when she
(55)
into the store to buy some dog
food. I remember being very impressed
by her politeness and friendliness to the
store owner. At the time I was staying
in a house owned (56)
Cathy Kelly,
another amazing lady who has this huge
house which she keeps open to anyone
who needs a bed for the night. There
(57)
lots of us in the house, which
was good for me as I was feeling
particularly lonely and was suffering
from culture shock. I still do, to a lesser
extent. I Ànally met Josephine when
Cathy introduced us at her house one
day. Josephine was beautiful and kind to
me when we Ànally spoke.
I had left Vietnam a few weeks before
and to cut a long story short, I ended up
in Los Angeles. It was very strange, so
different from what I knew back home.
There was so much to do, so many
(58)
. Josephine took me to concerts
and political meeting and sometimes to
the theatre although I understood very
little. We saw quite a lot of each other
in those Àrst few months. At one point
we were seeing each other every day
(59)
she was teaching me English.
A few weeks ago, I told her that I
wanted to go to college and she's trying
to Ànd out if it's possible. She says she
will pay for my (60)
. I am surprised
that her family let her live alone. In my
country, the whole family lives in the
same house, old people and young. But
if she didn’t live alone, I guess I wouldn't
see her so often.
I place great value on the friends
Josephine has helped me make and on
my friendship with her.

The Two Friends and the Bear
John and James were two friends who were crossing a
1
forest. Suddenly, they hit a huge black 2bear. Imagine how
terriÀed they were. They tried to run but the bear 3chased
them. 4John managed to climb up into a tree but, 5James fell to
the ground and pretended to be dead. He knew that a bear will
only attack something if it is 6alive.
The bear 7smelled him all over, while the man tried to
hold his breath as best he could, hoping that the animal would
not discover the pretence. Finally, the bear must have thought
that the man really was 8dead.
Finally, the danger over. John came down from the tree
and asked his friend, “Well, what did the bear 9whisper into
your ear?” The bear 10said, “That it would be good if you fell
from the tree and pretended to be dead with me!”
