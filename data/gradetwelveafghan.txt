The Message
from his Excellency Minister of Education
Dear teachers and students,
As education is the foundation of development, a key element in defining
quality, relevance and effectiveness of education is its curriculum. Our new
curriculum has been shaped by the desires of our people for an ideal future using
the latest advances in education development. Our education system and curricula
should provide the type of education that will enable our future generations to
build an Islamic society that is moral, modern and prosperous. Through widespread consultations, the Ministry of Education has attempted to come up with
content, structure, scope and sequence for various curricula that will equip our
children and youth with values, knowledge and skills that are essential for
assisting the learners to become positive and contributing members of their
families and their society. I am confident that the curriculum development teams
of the Ministry of Education tried hard to incorporate the latest developments in
the science of learning, educational psychology as well as mental, intellectual and
emotional development of children, as they developed the new curriculum. It is
my honor to assure our students, teachers and their families that the school
curriculum is not a means for spreading political ideologies.
I hope this textbook precisely represent our intentions and efforts to offer you
the best resource for learning and application. This book is designed to meet the
learning needs of the pupils and facilitate active participation of students in
learning and teaching processes.
I expect our teachers to apply the active teaching methods to engage all
students and carefully follow the Teacher’s Guide to facilitate active learning.
Teachers are required to provide opportunities for all students to learn by doing;
understand through discovery; use imagination, thinking, creativity; and take joy
in instructional activities.
I also call on the guardians and parents of the students to take interest in the
education of their daughters and sons, participate in school’s gatherings, and turn
learning into a daily family routine. Parents can both give by helping their
children with their studies and take by learning from the school curriculum
through their children. Raising our future generation is a joint responsibility of
the families and the Ministry of Education.

e

Ministry of Education is committed to a constant improvement of our
curriculum; therefore, I welcome parents, scholars, and educationalists to provide
us with feedback for improving our curricula, textbooks and other resource
materials.
I wholeheartedly appreciate the hard work of the authors, reviewers, editors,
composers, designers and other who participated in preparation of this textbook. I
am also grateful to the support of the institutions and experts, national and
international, and donors for supporting the process and especially printing and
distribution of our textbooks.
May Allah bless us all
Farooq Wardak
Minister of Education

READING
Some water under the Sahara Desert in
North Africa has lain there for 25, 000
years. Other underground water does not
lie in one place but moves slowly
downhill over hard rock. Water like this
is used by people at cases, wells and bore
holes all over the world. However, the
largest source of fresh water has never
been used at all. About 90% of all fresh
water in the world is in Antarctica. It is
unusable because it is remote and is in
the form of ice and snow.
When the word water is mentioned,
nearly everybody first thinks of water for
drinking. But actually, in some countries,
people drink only a small percentage of
the water they use. In the UK, for
example, each person uses an average of
about 180 liters of water per day. Of that,
only about 3% is used for cooking and
drinking. People use most of the rest for
washing dishes, clothes and themselves
and in the toilet. In industries, water is
used for a variety of purposes. It takes 1
liter of water to make 2 kilos of bread. It
is used in the producing of electricity and
at atomic power stations. Of course it is
also used world-wide in the cultivation
and irrigation of crops. So water now has
a variety of uses. As the population of
the world grows, the demand for water
will increase too. It may become even
more precious than it is today.

Nearly three-quarters of the world is
covered by water. The Pacific Ocean has
a larger surface area than all the dry land
on earth. Unfortunately, this water itself
is no good for drinking. It is too salty.
However, the water that is evaporated
from it by the heat of the sun is not too
salty. Tiny drops of fresh water mix with
the air and sometimes become clouds in
the sky. If the water in the clouds grows
too heavy, it falls to earth again. About
four-fifth goes directly back into the sea.
But if the rain falls on land, the fresh
water can be used by the living things
there. Most of it, however, either returns
to the sea in rivers or disappears
underground.
There are several different sources of
drinking water. In some areas, dams
prevent rivers from returning rainwater
to the sea. Reservoirs are formed to
provide drinking water all year round. In
other places, rainwater drains through
the earth’s surface and collects in lakes
or rivers underneath.

A. Read the following passage about Hekmat’s Private School silently.

Private school education is a new phenomenon in our
country. The Ministry of Education formulated laws
and regulations to provide guideline for private
schools. As there is a fairly good competition among
private schools, the owners of these schools provided
more facilities to students. Some of them have worked
hard to get good reputation and become more popular
among people.
My friend Hekmat also established a private school in
the city. Before establishing school, he calculated all
the expenditures carefully. Now the school has been
built and it has wonderful building. Its class-rooms
are built very spacious and there is a big library for
students. As the school was established according to
the private school regulations, the Ministry of
Education issued a license for Hekmat. The
curriculum of the school is progressive and the
Ministry is in agreement with it.
While the teachers of the school work hard and attend
their classes regularly, there are a lot of students

How Could this Happen?
Millions of Animal and
Plant Species Face
Extinction.
Scientists still do not know exactly
how many animal and plant species
exist on our planet. They guess that
there may be between 5 million and
30 million. Only 1.7 million of them
have been identified and described.
In January 1989, the director of a
famous botanical garden in the U.S.A
predicted that during the next thirty
years man will cause an extinction of
an average of 100 animal and plant
species every day. This is a yearly
average of about 36, 500 species. If
extinctions continue at this rate, there
may be almost no animals or plants
on this planet by the year 2200 AD!

There are several reasons for this. One
thing is that man often hunts and fishes
too efficiently nowadays. For example,
fishermen hunt whales from “factory
ships”. And hunters of elephants and
rhinoceroses have even used helicopters
and machine – guns. As a result, these
animals are all in danger of
disappearing.
Another reason is pollution of the
environment. Animals need a clean
environment but we have been
polluting the rivers, seas and land for
over 150 years.
However, the main cause of these
extinctions is deforestation in the
tropics. Tropical forests cover only 7%
of the earth’s surface, but they are the
home of between 50% and 80% of the
earth’s species. Many tropical countries
are cutting down their forests very
quickly. They are doing this in order to
create more land for agriculture.

21

They also need the wood for fuel and
for building. However, they are killing
trees and plants, and at the same time
destroying the homes of many animals.
This is a big problem in South
America, in parts of Africa and in some
Asian countries such as the Philippines.
Sometimes, man means to do
something good but he damages his
environment by mistake. An example
of this comes from South America.
There used to be a bird which was
found in only one place in the world –
near a lake in Guatemala. One day,
scientists decided to introduce a new
species of fish into the lake as food for
humans. The new fish ate the birds’
food sources and by 1987 these birds
had all been made extinct.

However, millions of small and little-known
species are also threatened with extinction.
Insects and plants are especially vulnerable
as their forest homes are destroyed, we must
not forget that each of these species depends
on many others for its survival.

When one disappears, others may lose an
important source of food. Moreover, man
can learn from plants and insects and use
them to improve his own life on this
planet. Wild plants, for example, contain
substances that can be used to make
medicines as well as natural fertilizers
and pesticides.

Is There a Solution?

What can be done about the problem? We
cannot re-introduce the species which
have already disappeared. However, it
may not be too late to start protecting
some of the creatures and plants which

READING
Travelers who want to take a trip to distant
cities or countries frequently have to
decide whether they would prefer to travel
by land, sea or air. There are different
means of transportation such as: cars, ships
and airplanes. Hardly anyone can enjoy
sitting in a train for more than few hours.
Train compartments soon get restricted and
stuffy.
It is almost impossible to take your mind
off the journey. Reading is only partial
solution, for the droning rhythm of the
wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you
to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in
snatches. At night, when you really wish to
go to sleep, it will be difficult for you to do
so.Long car journeys have also difficulties; it
is very hard for you to read anything.
However, traveling at motorway is fairly
safe and you can drive at a high speed. But
when you use highways and side roads,
you are facing a lot of problems, because
the greater part of your trip is spent on
narrow, bumpy roads which are crowded
with traffic.
Traveling by ships is relatively good and it
has variety of comports, you can stretch
your legs on the spacious decks, play
games, swim, meet interesting people and
enjoy good food when the sea is calm and
the weather is pleasant. If it is not, and you
are likely to get sea-sick, no form of
transport or means of travel could be worse
than ships. Another problem of sea journey
is that it takes a long time to arrive at
destination.

Nonetheless, if you take your trip by
airplanes, you will enjoy it more than any
other means of transportation.
Traveling at a high of 30, 000 feet, for above
the clouds and at over 500 miles an hour is an
exhilarating experience, you do not have to
devise ways of taking your mind off the
journey, for an airplane gets you to your
destination rapidly. For a few hours, you
settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the
flight.
An airplane offers you an unusual and
breathtaking view of the world. You soar
effortlessly over high mountains and deep
valleys. If landscape is hidden from view, you
can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken
cloud plains that stretch out for miles before
you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear
sky. The journey is so smooth that there is
nothing to prevent you from reading or
sleeping. You will arrive at your destination
fresh and relax. You will not have to stand the
next few days recovering from a long and
difficult journey.

Read the above information again and answer the following questions.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Why sleeping is difficult in train?
What are the difficulties in long car journeys?
What are the facilities and problems of traveling by ships?
Which transportation is the most enjoyable? Why?

READING

Islam is based on fine beliefs. These are called The five pillars of
Islam. The first belief is that there is no God but Allah and that
Muhammad (peace be upon him) is his Messenger. The second is that
a Muslim must pray five times a day at certain times, and the third is
that a Muslim must give a percentage of his/her savings to the poor.
The fourth is the fasting of Ramadan. The fifth is that all Muslims
who are able should perform Hajj (Pilgrimage) at least once in their
life.
Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. All adult
Muslims must fast during the daylight hours. They are not allowed to
eat or drink between dawn and sunset for the whole month. Fasting
strengthens a person by increasing his self-control. Fasting also helps
a Muslim to remember Allah and his obedience. During Ramadan,
the soreness of hunger is shared by everyone. In this way, everyone is
equal next to Allah.
Some people (children for example) are excused from fasting. Some
may be too old or too ill. Others are the people, who are on journeys,
and women who are expecting or feeling difficulties in nursing their
babies and cannot fast at that time, either. However, all those who are
able must complete their fast later.
Ramadan customs are very special. Many Muslims prefer to change
working hours so that they can focus on the Islamic duties of the
Holy Month. At sunset, the Mula announces and people break their
fast with dates and water. Then, they go to the mosque for the sunset
prayers (Maghrib). Also the exact time of sunset is very important.
There is a special night known as “LailatulQadr”. No one knows
exactly which night it is, but is definitely one of the last odd ten
nights of the month. Around this time, Muslims try to stay awake all
night and perform special prayers.
Immediately after the last day of Ramadan, There is a celebration
called Eid-Al-Fitr. Muslims all over the world celebrate this
holiday. During Eid, Muslims wear new clothes and receive
gifts. Families everywhere enjoy themselves with friends and
relatives. They thank Allah for His great blessings in revealing
the Holy Qur’an during the Holy Month of Ramadan

Some Statistics
Earth is about twice as big as Mars.
Its diameter is around 12, 700
kilometers. There are approximately
365 days in a year on Earth. That is
the time it takes to make a complete
orbit of the sun. There are 24 hours
in a day. This is the time it takes to

spin once around it’s own axis.

The Earth’s axis is not vertical. It is tilted
at an angle of about 13o. As it goes round
the sun, different parts become closer to
it. For this reason the Earth has seasons.
Summer is in the hemisphere that is
nearer to the sun. Winter is in the one
that is further away.

Water
On Earth’s surface, water is found in
two more forms. As solid ice, it is
found mostly near the North Pole and
South Pole. Elsewhere, it is liquid. In
rain, streams, rivers and most lakes it
is fresh water. In the sea, it is salt
water.

Life on Earth
Earth is unique. It is the only known
planet that has got life on it. Life cannot
exist on any of the other planets in our

Their

(Do we know when he lived?)
(Is he alive now?)

Remember that verbs can be
Or

regular
irregular

e.g.

GRAMMAR
The past tense can be used in the active or in the passive:

Those novels were written by Dickens, weren’t

Dickens wrote those novels, didn’t he?

The verb be does not have any helping verbs in the past:
Shakespeare was a poet. Dickens was

not a poet.

Were Shakespeare and Dickens writers? Yes, they were.

In if clauses, the past tense does not show past time.
It shows that the idea is unlikely, imagined or impossible.

GRAMMAR

Look at the verbs in these two sentences and look at what follows the verbs:

A. He raises his hand.

B. The sun rises.

In A, there is an object (his hand) after the verb.
A verb which can be followed by an object is called a transitive verb.

raise

is a transitive verb.

In B, there is no object after the verb.
A verb which cannot be followed by an object is called an intransitive verb.

rise

is an intransitive verb.

This is a very important difference between verbs in English because intransitive verbs
cannot be used in the passive.
You can say this

His hand is raised

But
You cannot say this:

The sun is risen.

* Dictionaries show if a verb is transitive or intransitive, e.g.
(vt)

transitive

(vi)

intransitive

Pay close attention to the clauses with who, which or that:

1

Pupils who come to class late are not allowed in the classroom.
(Without the who clause, the sentence has an unusual meaning.)
The part of the year which is cold is called winter.
Without the which clause, we do not know which part of the year is meant.)
Try taking out the who and which clauses and see what happens.
*There are no commas before or after who, which or that clauses like this.

Now look at the following sentences with who, which or that clauses:

RIVISION
Remember how we use while with the past continuous tense:
I was visiting my friend.

Now

I went to the Garden

Here are some more examples:
While he was leading the government of Afghanistan,
his desire to make his nation's education level increased.
While he was traveling to Badakhshan for sightseeing,
his car had a puncture.
While he was waiting for repairs,
a man on a horse came near.
*Remember: there is a comma after the while clause when it begins a
sentence and the word While has a capital letter.

We can also change the order of the sentences:
His desire to make his nation's education level increased,
while he was leading the government of Afghanistan.
His car had a puncture.
while he was traveling to Badakhshan for sightseeing.
A man on a horse rode and came near.
while he was waiting for repairs.
*Remember: there is no comma after the while clause when it begins
a sentence and the word While has a capital letter.

120

Pay attention to the following sentence:
Not recognizing Baryalai the director, he asked if the director had passed by already.

The beginning of this sentence is a phrase verb + ing. It explains why
he asked the question.
When a sentence begins with verb + ing, it can show:
Why

something was done

Or

when

something was done

Or

how

something was done.

Look at these examples:
Why: Not recognizing Baryalai the director, he asked if the director had passed by.
Living in Jalalabad, we often visit the garden.
When: Crossing the road, he was hit by a car.
How: Using a knife, he opened the letter.
*Remember: there is a comma after those phrases that introduce a sentence.
*Note: sentences like these are common in written English, but they are not usually
heard in spoken English.

121

A. Change the order of these sentences. If they begin with While, change them so
that they do not. If they do not begin with while, change them so that they do.
Remember: if the sentence begins with While, you will need a comma.

1.

While she was playing, she lost her watch.

2.

I broke my pencil while I was writing the answers.

3.

While I was watching TV, the phone rang.

4.

6.

While it was raining, the explorer collected water in a tin.

B. Change these sentences. If they are with _________ ing, change them to begin
with the word in brackets at the end. If they do not begin with _________ ing,
make them do so.

1.

Finding the door locked, the policemen broke it down.

You already know the word some, but this example is a little different.
Can you see why this example is different from examples you have

In questions, the word any is normally used, but look at this question again;
Can you tell us something about your adventure?
In this question, the word something is used instead of anything.
The word some, something, someone, somebody and somewhere are often
used in questions when we expect the answer Yes. Look at these examples:

Can I borrow some money until tomorrow, please?
You look ill. Is there something wrong with you?
Will someone open the window, please?
Can somebody lend me a pencil, please?
Let's go to a restaurant. Do you know somewhere nice?

It is faster than yours.
Remember that we add (er) to many adjectives when we want to compare two things
and add than if we name both.
Clear……………………….. clearer (than that)
Fast……………………… faster (than that)
But remember these spelling rules:
If an adjective ends with an e, add r only:
Safe………………………... safer (than that)
Simple……………………..simpler (than that)
If the adjective ends with a y, change the y to ier.
Easy………………………. Easier (than that)

And remember that some adjectives are irregular:
Good…………………….better (than that)
Bad………………………. Worst (than that)

As there are different scripts in
Arabic, Dari and Pashto
calligraphy which you recognize
them as Nastaliq, Naskh, and
Kufi, have English language also
many different scripts. Perhaps
they are not so important in
English nowadays as different
scripts are in Arabic, Dari and
Pashto. Calligraphy is probably
the most important form of art
for Muslims. It is seen not only
in the holy Qur’an and in books,
but also in many other places. It
is used, for the decoration of
buildings. There are wallhangings, framed samples and
inscriptions inside and outside
public and private buildings. In
the western world, the art of
calligraphy declined with the
introduction of printing and
typewriters. However, it is now
becoming more popular again
and calligraphers are in demand
to illustrate books, posters,
cards, letterheads and many
other things.

Some of the different
English scripts are so
common that you will
almost certainly see
them in your reading.
Three of the most
common scripts used
are Roman (based on
letters developed by
the Romans about
2,000 years ago).
Gothic
(which
developed in northern
Europe between 10th
and 15th centuries AD
and Italic (from 15th
and 16th century Italy.)
There
are
some
examples of alphabets
in these three scripts in
the top of the next
page.

144

How common are these
scripts and where will you
see them? Roman script is
probably the most common.
This is because it is the
clearest and easiest to read.
Almost all the newspapers,
magazines and books which
you will ever see in English
use some form of the Roman
script. Gothic script is quite
difficult to read, even for
native speakers. It is usually
seen on letter heads, in the
names of newspapers, and
outside buildings. Italic
scripts as you see it on the
next page is always written
by hand. However, a slanted
version of Roman script is
often used in printing to
stress or emphasize things,
and this is also called Italic.
Look at the examples on the
next page. Decide which of
the English scripts is used in
each example and why it is
used.

GRAMMAR

Look at these adjectives and learn them carefully:
It has two new 89-meter-high minarets.
It covers a 9-square-kilometer area.
It has many 46-meter-high pillars.

Note the hyphens:
89-meter-high

Note there is no S to show the plural.

Here are some more examples:

A ten-Afghani note.

He is a 13-year-old boy.

The Kabah is a 13. 8 - meter-high building.

155

Grammar

Look at this sentence from the conversation in lesson 1:
The Holy Mosque in Makkah now has room for 730,000
worshippers.
The words room and worshippers are both nouns. However, they are very
different.
They have different meanings, of course, but there is another important
difference.

You can count worshippers but you cannot count room.
(Remember. This word room means space. It is not the same as a room in
a house. You can count the rooms in a house.)

We call worshippers a countable noun. We call room an
uncountable noun.
It is important to know if a noun is countable or uncountable because
you cannot do certain things with uncountable nouns:
 You cannot use numbers with uncountable nouns.
 You cannot use a or an with uncountable nouns.
 You cannot make uncountable nouns plural.
 You cannot ask questions with How many …?
(You must use How much …?)
 You cannot use fewer / the fewest (You must use less / the least.)

156

GRAMMAR
A. Answer the following questions. What kind of …..is it? With adjectives
like these:
a

five-Afghanis

a

boy

1. This note has a value of ten Afghani. (What kind of note is it?)
It is a
2. That boy is 13 years old. (What kind of building is it?)
3. That building has eight floors. (What kind of building is it?)
4. That apartment has two rooms. (What kind of apartment is it?)
5. That bridge is ten meters wide. (What kind of bridge is it?)

6. This lesson lasts 45 minutes. (What kind of lesson is it?)

7. His family has three cars. (What kind of family is it?)
8. Our Holiday lasts two weeks. (What kind of holiday is it?)
9. Our watch counts 24 hours every day. (What kind of watch is it?)
10. That tent can hold three persons. (What kind of tent is it?)

157

B. You can find out if a noun is countable or uncountable by looking in a
dictionary. In many dictionaries, countable nouns have (ne) after
them and uncountable nouns have (nu) after them. Here are two
examples.

READING

The Holy Mosque at the Time of the Prophet Muhammad
(Peace Be Upon Him)
Expansion between the Year 1 AH and 1375 AH

160

On Tuesday, 2 Safar 1409 AH (13 September 1988 AD), the
Custodian of the Two Holly Mosques, King Fahd, laid the foundation
stone for a new addition to the Holly Mosques at Makkah AlMukarramah.

History
This is not the first time that the Mosque has
been expanded. If you look at the plans in the
previews page, you will see that it was enlarged
eight times between the days of the prophet
Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and the Saudi
period.

Expansion under the Al-Saud Family
The first expansion
The first Saudi expansion took place
between 1375 and 1396 AH (1955 and 1976 AD).
You can see how large this was on the right.

161

The First Saudi Expansion
(1375-1396 AH)

The second Saudi Expansion
With the latest expansion, the total area of the
Holly Mosques has reached 361, 000m. This
gives enough room for 730, 000 worshippers
for everyday prayer and Umrah. The number
which it can accommodate has increased to 1,
000,000 during the pilgrimage season.

What has been added?
The main addition is a large annex built onto
the western side of the Mosque where 140,
000 worshippers can pray. It consists of three
floors; a basement, a ground floor and a first
floor. The annex has one main entrance,
fourteen secondary entrances and two new 89meter-high minarets. The Mosque now has a
total of three main entrances and twenty-seven
secondary entrances. Each of the minarets is
similar in height and design to the seven
minarets which the Mosque had before.
In addition to this, a large open plaza has
been created to the east of Al- Mas’a (between
As – Safa and Al – Marwah) which can
accommodate 65, 000 worshippers.

Escalators
In order to help pilgrims, particularly elderly
ones, to move from floor to floor, two new
escalators have been built next to the
extension; one at the northern end and one at
the southern end. Each of these can handle
15,000 people per hour.

162

Power and Ventilation
Two new power stations provide the electricity for the additional
lighting, loudspeakers, TV studios, telephones and clocks. Central airconditioning has been provided for the basement. The ground floor and
first floor are ventilated by the natural flow of air from windows and doors,
aided by ceiling fans.

Water
The new building includes a modern rainfall drainage system.
Zamzam water is available to pilgrims from 60 taps on the ground floor
and 36 on the first floor. A sewer network and a fire- fighting sprinkler
system have also been built in.

This model shows the completed expansion very clearly.
